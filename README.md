# Backend API with PHP (Laravel) and MySQL

## Project Overview

This project is a backend API built using PHP (Laravel) and MySQL. It provides endpoints for user authentication, inventory management, and sales tracking.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to set up the following tools:

1. **PHP**: Make sure PHP is installed on your system.
2. **MySQL**: Install MySQL for database management.
3. **Composer**: This is PHP's dependency manager, similar to npm for JavaScript. For what purposes? Welp, tt is used for managing packages, such as installing useful packages like web-token, qr-code, etc., so you don't have to code them yourself.

After installing these tools, follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBaM5LYgyPk) to configure PHP and install Laravel; installing Laravel just sucks and is harder than coding in PHP lmaoo. The video will guide you through the necessary PHP configurations and the installation process for Laravel.
